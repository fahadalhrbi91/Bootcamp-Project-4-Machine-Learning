# Bootcamp-Project-4-Machine-Learning

**Based on what you’ve learned until now, use NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to create a project of your choosing.**

This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:

- Choose a public dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- EDA
    - Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, and missing values
    - Display different charts that give an overview of your data.
- Use two splitting methods (train-test split and cross-validation split).
- Choose three proper ML Algorithms.
- Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model.
- Create a chart that compares the final results of your selected models.
- Write a final conclusion and recommendations (your interpretation of the results).
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
    - Team members (with the roles).
    - Introduction (problem or your goal).
    - Dataset Overview and Source.
    - A table represents the final results of ML models.
- [Nice to have - Optional] Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly.


- Due Date: Sun, 10 Jun, at 11:00 p.m.
- The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).

### Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
